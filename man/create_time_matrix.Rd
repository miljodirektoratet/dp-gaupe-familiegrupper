\title{Create Temporal Distance Matrix}
\usage{
create_time_matrix(activity_from, activity_to)
}
\arguments{
\item{activity_from}{Vector of POSIXct or Date objects representing the start
of activity periods.}

\item{activity_to}{Vector of POSIXct or Date objects representing the end
of activity periods. Must be the same length as activity_from.}
}
\value{
A symmetric numeric matrix where element \link{i,j} represents the minimum
temporal distance in days between observation i and observation j. A small
constant (0.001) is added to prevent zero distances. Values are ceiled to
integers.
}
\description{
Calculates a symmetric matrix of temporal distances (in days) between all
pairs of lynx observations based on their activity periods.
}
\details{
The function calculates temporal overlap by considering all four possible
combinations of start and end times between pairs of observations:
\itemize{
\item from\link{i} to from\link{j}
\item from\link{i} to to\link{j}
\item to\link{i} to from\link{j}
\item to\link{i} to to\link{j}
}
The maximum of these four distances is taken as the temporal distance,
then ceiled to the nearest integer day.

activity_from <- as.POSIXct(c("2024-01-01", "2024-01-05", "2024-01-10"))
