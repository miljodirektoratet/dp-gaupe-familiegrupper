\title{Create Temporal Distance Matrix}
\usage{
create_time_matrix(activity_from, activity_to)
}
\arguments{
\item{activity_from}{Vector of POSIXct or Date objects representing the start
of activity periods.}

\item{activity_to}{Vector of POSIXct or Date objects representing the end
of activity periods. Must be the same length as activity_from.}
}
\value{
A symmetric numeric matrix (n x n) where element \verb{[i,j]} represents the
maximum temporal distance in days between observation i and j. Diagonal
elements are 1 (same observation). All values are integers (ceiled).
}
\description{
Calculates the maximum temporal distance (in days) between all pairs of
lynx observation periods.
}
\details{
For each pair of observations, the function computes the temporal distance
between all four combinations of start/end times and returns the maximum.
This ensures the full temporal extent of both observation periods is considered.

Example: If observation A spans Jan 1-3 and observation B spans Jan 10-12,
the function calculates:
\itemize{
\item Start A to Start B: Jan 1 to Jan 10 = 9 days
\item Start A to End B: Jan 1 to Jan 12 = 11 days (maximum)
\item End A to Start B: Jan 3 to Jan 10 = 7 days
\item End A to End B: Jan 3 to Jan 12 = 9 days
}

The maximum (11 days) is used to conservatively measure temporal separation.
A small constant (0.001) is added before ceiling to ensure diagonal is 1.

\dontrun{
# Three observations with activity periods
activity_from <- as.POSIXct(c("2024-01-01", "2024-01-05", "2024-01-10"))
activity_to <- as.POSIXct(c("2024-01-03", "2024-01-07", "2024-01-12"))
time_matrix <- create_time_matrix(activity_from, activity_to)

# Output (3x3 symmetric matrix):
#      [,1] [,2] [,3]
# [1,]    1    7   12
# [2,]    7    1    8
# [3,]   12    8    1
#
# Where:
# - [1,1] = 1 (same observation)
# - [1,2] = 7 (max distance between obs 1 and 2)
# - [1,3] = 12 (max distance between obs 1 and 3)
