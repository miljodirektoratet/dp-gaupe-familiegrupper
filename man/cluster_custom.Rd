\title{Custom Clustering for Lynx Family Group Assignment}
\usage{
cluster_custom(grouping_indicator)
}
\arguments{
\item{grouping_indicator}{A logical or numeric matrix where \code{TRUE} (or 1)
indicates that two observations can be grouped together based on spatial
and temporal criteria. The matrix should be symmetric with diagonal values
representing self-grouping (typically \code{TRUE}).}
}
\value{
An integer vector of cluster assignments, with the same length as the
number of rows/columns in \code{grouping_indicator}. Each unique integer represents
a distinct family group.
}
\description{
Performs custom clustering based on a binary grouping indicator matrix.
Assigns observations to family groups by ensuring all observations within
a group can be connected to each other (complete linkage criterion).
}
\details{
The algorithm iteratively processes each observation:
\enumerate{
\item If an observation already has a group assignment, skip it
\item Find all observations that can potentially group with it
\item Check if all potential group members can group with each other (complete linkage)
\item If not, iteratively remove the observation with the most conflicts
\item Assign a new group ID to the final valid group
}

This approach ensures that within each group, every observation can be paired
with every other observation according to the grouping criteria (typically
spatial distance and temporal proximity rules).

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create a binary grouping indicator matrix
# TRUE means observations can be grouped together
grouping_indicator <- matrix(c(
  TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE,
  TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE,
  FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE,
  FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE
), nrow = 4, byrow = TRUE)

# Perform clustering
clusters <- cluster_custom(grouping_indicator)
# Expected: c(1, 1, 2, 2) - two groups of two observations each
}
