\usage{
minimize_group_distances(
  group_assignments,
  distance_matrix,
  grouping_indicator
)
}
\arguments{
\item{group_assignments}{An integer vector of initial group assignments for each observation.}

\item{distance_matrix}{A numeric matrix of pairwise distances between observations.}

\item{grouping_indicator}{A logical or numeric matrix where \code{TRUE} (or 1) indicates
that two observations can be grouped together based on distance/temporal rules.}
}
\value{
An integer vector of optimized group assignments with the same length as
the input \code{group_assignments}. Group IDs remain the same, but observations may
be reassigned to minimize total internal distances.
}
\description{
Iteratively refines group assignments by reassigning each observation to the
group that minimizes the sum of internal distances across all groups. This
optimization improves group compactness after initial clustering.
}
\details{
The algorithm iteratively processes each observation:
\enumerate{
\item Identifies all valid alternative groups the observation could join
\item For each alternative, calculates the total internal distance if the observation were reassigned
\item Selects the group assignment that minimizes the sum of all internal distances
\item Continues until no further improvements are possible (convergence)
}

This function is typically run after \code{reduce_group_count()} to fine-tune the
quality of group assignments by making them more spatially compact.

The optimization criterion is the sum of all pairwise distances within each group,
summed across all groups in the dataset.
