\title{Create Distance Rule Matrix}
\usage{
apply_distance_rules(time_matrix, prey_class, dist_rules = NULL, max_days = 11)
}
\arguments{
\item{time_matrix}{A symmetric matrix of temporal distances (e.g., days) between observations.}

\item{prey_class}{A character or factor vector of prey class for each observation (length must match nrow(time_matrix)).}

\item{dist_rules}{A data.frame with columns: prey_class1, prey_class2, temporal_distance_days, distance_threshold_m (distance threshold in meters). Defaults to the package dataset \code{lut_distance_rules} if not supplied.}

\item{max_days}{The maximum number of days to use for rule lookup (values above are capped). Default: 11.}
}
\value{
A symmetric matrix of distance thresholds (same dimensions as time_matrix).
}
\description{
Generates a matrix of spatial distance thresholds for each observation pair, based on their prey classes and temporal separation.
}
\details{
For each observation pair, looks up the allowed spatial distance threshold in dist_rules (defaults to \code{lut_distance_rules} from the package) based on their prey classes and temporal separation. Diagonal is set to Inf.
