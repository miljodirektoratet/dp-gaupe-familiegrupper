\title{Create Spatial Distance Matrix}
\usage{
create_distance_matrix(geometry)
}
\arguments{
\item{geometry}{An sfc geometry column (typically from an sf object) containing
the spatial locations of observations. Must be valid s2 geometries.}
}
\value{
A symmetric numeric matrix where element \link{i,j} represents the maximum
spatial distance in meters between observation i and observation j,
calculated on the sphere using Earth's radius.
}
\description{
Calculates a symmetric matrix of maximum spatial distances (in meters)
between all pairs of lynx observations using the s2 spherical geometry library.
}
\details{
This function uses the s2 library to calculate spherical distances on Earth's
surface, which is more accurate than planar distance calculations for
geographic coordinates. The s2_max_distance_matrix function computes the
maximum distance between geometries, which is particularly relevant for
polygon or linestring geometries where the maximum distance may be greater
than the distance between centroids.
