\title{Create Spatial Distance Matrix}
\usage{
create_distance_matrix(geometry)
}
\arguments{
\item{geometry}{An sfc geometry column containing
the spatial locations of observations.}
}
\value{
A symmetric numeric matrix where element \verb{[i,j]} represents the maximum
spatial distance in meters between observation i and observation j,
calculated on the sphere using Earth's radius.
}
\description{
Calculates a matrix of maximum spatial distances (in meters)
between all pairs of lynx observations.
}
\details{
This function uses the s2 library to calculate spherical distances on Earth's
surface, which is more accurate than planar distance calculations for
geographic coordinates. The s2_max_distance_matrix function computes the
maximum distance between geometries, which is particularly relevant for
polygon or linestring geometries where the maximum distance may be greater
than the distance between centroids.

\examples{
\dontrun{
library(sf)
# Create sample point data at three locations in Norway
points <- st_sfc(
  st_point(c(10, 60)),
  st_point(c(11, 61)),
  st_point(c(12, 62)),
  crs = 3006
)
dist_matrix <- create_distance_matrix(points)

# Output (3x3 symmetric matrix, distances in meters):
#         [,1]     [,2]     [,3]
# [1,]       0   152891   304346
# [2,]  152891        0   152024
# [3,]  304346   152024        0
#
# Where:
# - [1,1] = 0 (same point)
# - [1,2] = 152891 (distance between point 1 and 2 in meters)
# - [1,3] = 304346 (distance between point 1 and 3 in meters)
