\title{Order Lynx Observations}
\usage{
order_observations(
  data,
  reversed = FALSE,
  which_order = c("time", "pca1", "pca2", "north-south", "east-west", "random")[1],
  time_column = "datotid_fra"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{An sf object containing lynx observations with geometry and
temporal information.}

\item{reversed}{Logical. If TRUE, reverses the ordering direction.
Default is FALSE.}

\item{which_order}{Character string specifying the ordering method. One of:
\itemize{
\item "time" - Order by temporal column
\item "pca1" - Order by first principal component of coordinates
\item "pca2" - Order by second principal component of coordinates
\item "north-south" - Order by latitude (north to south)
\item "east-west" - Order by longitude (east to west)
\item "random" - Random ordering
}
Default is "time".}

\item{time_column}{Character string specifying the name of the temporal
column to use for time-based ordering. Only used when which_order = "time".
Default is "datotid_fra".}
}
\value{
An sf object with observations reordered according to the specified
method and row names reset to sequential integers.
}
\description{
Orders spatial observations using different methods including temporal,
spatial (PCA), cardinal directions, or random ordering. This function is
used to determine the starting point for clustering algorithms.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Order by time (default)
ordered_data <- order_observations(lynx_data)

# Order by time with custom column name
ordered_data <- order_observations(lynx_data, time_column = "activity_from")

# Order by first principal component, reversed
ordered_data <- order_observations(lynx_data, reversed = TRUE, which_order = "pca1")

# Random ordering
ordered_data <- order_observations(lynx_data, which_order = "random")
}
}
